# KimiaNet_Public

This Repository contains a sample code showing how to use KimiaNet as a feature extractor in TensorFlow.
[KimiaNet](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1361841521000785) is a CNN, based on DenseNet-121 architecture, trained from scratch using the publicly available TCGA dataset and can be utilized as a feature extractor for histopathology images. KimiaNet is presented in the paper titled "Fine-Tuning and Training of DenseNet for Histopathology Image Representation Using TCGA Diagnostic Slides" published at the special issue in Computational Pathology of the Medical Image Analysis journal. In order to run the code, download the network weights from the [Kimia Lab website](https://kimialab.uwaterloo.ca/kimia/index.php/data-and-code-2/kimia-net/) (Keras weights should be used).
