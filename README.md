# KimiaNet_Public

This Repository contains a sample code showing how to use KimiaNet as a feature extractor in TensorFlow.
[KimiaNet](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1361841521000785) is a CNN, based on DenseNet-121 architecture, trained from scratch using the publicly available TCGA dataset and can be utilized as a feature extractor for histopathology images. KimiaNet is presented in the paper published at the special issue in Computational Pathology of the Medical Image Analysis journal. The network weights, dataset details and other relevant files can be found at the [Kimia Lab website](https://kimialab.uwaterloo.ca/kimia/index.php/data-and-code-2/kimia-net/).
